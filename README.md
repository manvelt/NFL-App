# NFL Weekly Picker App
*Create a NFL weekly game picker app using MEAN stack*

The user will be navigate to the login page.
They will type in their credentials, and be brought to the main game picker page.
In this page, the user will go through each of the current week's matchups and choose
who they think the winner will be of each game. The UI will be responsive to the user as 
they go through and select winners. There will be information associated with each game including
date, time, stadium and what the weather will be like that day. The user will also be given the option to
filter games by their favorite team as opposed to scrolling through the whole list. 


On a more technical approach to things, this app will be run using MEAN stack. All of the game and team information
will be stored in a Mongo database and use Mongoose as the Object Data Mapper. Express will be used to run the 
server-side node application and the REST API. AngularJS will handle all of the front-end interactions.
